VISUAL PORTFOLIO:
For this section, let’s use Interactive Marquee Card Grid OR SCROLL VELOCITY

sample text for the label:
PUBMATS
Digital marketing, event promotions, and digital campaigns

This component features a horizontally scrolling marquee of cards, with a fade effect on the left and right edges for a smooth, seamless transition. When hovered over, the selected card zooms in slightly, tilts, and reveals its title and details, while the other non-selected cards are blurred, enhancing focus on the active card.

Each of them have at least 10 cards. 10 on top, 10 on bottom/
PUBMATS (10)
SHIRT DESIGNS/MERCH (10)
LOGOFOLIO (10)
TEAM ROSTERS/BANNERS (10)

NAV: CERTIFICATES:
H1: CERTIFICATIONS
H2: NAME OF THE CERTIFICATION
chips: year
This section features a React Card Swap Component on the right side, where each certification is represented as a clickable tab. The tabs are displayed in a stack, with the top tab slightly offset to the left, showing the name of the certification (e.g., CODECHUM, GOOGLE, etc.). Upon clicking any certification tab, the corresponding certificate image smoothly swaps into view, with the image positioned centrally in the component for a clear focus.

Additionally, when a certification is clicked, a modal is triggered, allowing the user to view the certificate up close for better visibility and detail. This modal enhances the interactive experience, providing a closer look at the certifications without leaving the page.

The certificates included are:

CODECHUM
GOOGLE (Link to certificate)
TOUR
ITS
PSITS NIKOLODEONS
GEE GRAPHICS

This design not only highlights each certification with a sleek card swap animation but also makes it easy for users to interact and explore the certifications in more detail.
